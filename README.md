# crop_produ_powerbi
This project analyzes India's crop production using Python, SQL, and Power BI. It involves data cleaning, EDA, and visualization to uncover trends in rice, wheat, and oilseeds. Python handles analysis, SQL structures data, and Power BI creates interactive dashboards, offering insights into agricultural production trends. ðŸš€


Crop Production Analysis Using Python, SQL, and Power BI
Project Overview
This project analyzes crop production in India using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The goal is to derive meaningful insights into agricultural trends by cleaning and processing large datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing key patterns.

Python: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.
SQL: Used to extract, aggregate, and analyze crop production data in a structured format.
Power BI: Used for interactive visual representations of the findings from both Python and SQL.
Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, NumPy, SciPy)
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL for querying and relational data analysis)
Power BI (For dashboards and interactive reports)
Project Workflow
1. Data Collection & Cleaning
Raw agricultural production datasets were sourced from public repositories.
Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency.
Python was used for exploratory analysis before performing structured SQL queries.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python
Key analyses performed:

Top 7 Rice-Producing States (Bar Plot)
Top 5 Wheat-Producing States (Bar Chart)
Top 5 Wheat-Producing States (Percentage Contribution)
Oilseed Production by Top 5 States (Pie Chart)
India's Sugarcane Production Over 50 Years (Line Plot)
Rice Production vs. Wheat Production Over 50 Years
Rice Production in West Bengal Districts
Top 10 Years of Wheat Production in Uttar Pradesh
Top 7 States for Groundnut Production
Oilseed Production Across Major States
Impact of Cultivated Area on Production (Rice, Wheat, Maize)
Rice vs. Wheat Yield Across Different States
Python visualizations were created using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to display insights effectively.

3. Data Analysis in SQL
Key SQL-based queries and insights include:

Year-wise Trend of Rice Production Across Top 3 States
Top 5 Districts by Wheat Yield Increase Over the Last 5 Years
States with the Highest Growth in Oilseed Production (5-Year Growth Rate)
District-wise Correlation Between Area and Production for Major Crops (Rice, Wheat, and Maize)
Districts with the Highest Groundnut Production in 2017
Annual Average Maize Yield Across All States
Total Area Cultivated for Oilseeds in Each State
Districts with the Highest Rice Yield
Comparison of Wheat and Rice Production for the Top 5 States Over 10 Years

4. Visualizing Insights in Power BI
Created dashboards to display production trends, growth patterns, and regional comparisons.
Used interactive charts, maps, and trend analysis to enhance data-driven decision-making.
Key Takeaways
Data-Driven Agriculture: The study provides valuable insights into production trends, helping policymakers and farmers make informed decisions.
Python & SQL Integration: Combined the power of structured querying with advanced data visualization.
Interactive Dashboards: Power BI visualizations enhance the interpretation of large datasets.
